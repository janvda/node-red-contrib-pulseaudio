# node-red-contrib-pulseaudio

This node allows you to control a [PulseAudio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PulseAudio) server.
The final goal is to support the same set of features as the X windows application [pavucontrol](https://freedesktop.org/software/pulseaudio/pavucontrol/).
Most typical features:

* get and set the volume of an audio device (speaker, microphone,...)
* if there are multiple connected audio devices, specify which audio device to use for playing audio/recording audio.
